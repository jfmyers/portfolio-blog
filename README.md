<h3>Blog/Portfolio Site</h3>
This is a very simple version of a blog/portfolio site. Feel free to repurpose for your own use. 
<br>
When I started learning Django I practiced by creating a portfolio site. Recently I've been playing around with Rails so I thought I'd do the same. Both the Django and Rails version are included in this repository.
